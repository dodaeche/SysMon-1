SysMon
======

Python qt system monitor which utilizes the Python psutil and platform modules to provide system information for display.

This application has been adapted to work with psutil version 1 and version 2 modules as there are some command syntax changes between these two versions.

The current version of SysMon is a standalone application which has been tested on Windows and RHEL Linux, but not on Mac yet.
